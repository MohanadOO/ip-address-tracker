## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- I learned how to use IP Geolocation API by [IPif](IPify.com) to get the location of the user's IP address or given address.
- How to use [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) to create a map of the user's IP address or the given IP address.

### Useful resources

- [Leaflet Docs](https://leafletjs.com/SlavaUkraini/examples/quick-start/) - A quick start guide to Leaflet.
- [Leaflet Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVnimcQsuwk&ab_channel=MapTiler) - This helped understand how the map function works and how to use it to display the map.
- [Ipify Docs](https://geo.ipify.org/docs) - The IP Geolocation API docs were very helpful and easy to understand on how to get the IP address, location (latitude, longitude, region and country) and ISP (Internet Service Provider). I used teh API Type 2 to get all the information I need.
